# Extracts just one release's section from RELEASE_NOTES.md, for use as a
# GitHub Release body (`gh release create --notes-file`) - RELEASE_NOTES.md
# itself holds the full history of every release, so it can't be used verbatim
# as a single release's notes.
#
# Each entry starts with a line like "## v0.3.0 — <summary>" and has a
# "### User-facing changes" subsection followed by a "### Details"
# subsection. This prints only from the "## vX.Y.Z" heading up to (not
# including) "### Details" - or up to the next "## v" heading as a fallback if
# an entry has no Details subsection at all.
#
# Usage: extract-release-notes.sh <tag> <release-notes-file>
# Prints the section to stdout; exits 1 if the tag has no matching heading.
